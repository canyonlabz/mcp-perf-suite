# Infrastructure table display options
# =====================================
# These settings control what columns are displayed in infrastructure metric tables.
# 
# Why you might disable allocation columns:
# - Resource allocation values come from datadog-mcp/environments.json and may be inaccurate
# - Some environments have no limits set (scale-on-demand cloud configurations)
# - Displaying potentially incorrect allocation values can cause confusion
# - You may want to focus on actual usage rather than theoretical limits
#
# When to keep allocation columns enabled:
# - Your environments.json has accurate resource allocation values
# - You want to show utilization as a percentage of allocated resources
# - Your team relies on allocation data for capacity planning

infrastructure_tables:
  # CPU Utilization (%) table settings
  # Affects the table in section "4.2 CPU Utilization by Service/Host"
  cpu_utilization:
    show_allocated_column: true    # Show "Allocated" column (e.g., "4 cores")
  
  # CPU Core Usage table settings
  # Affects the table in section "4.2.1 CPU Core Usage by Service/Host"
  cpu_core_usage:
    show_allocated_column: true    # Show "Allocated (Cores)" column
    # Unit configuration for comparison report tables
    # Options: "cores" (default) or "millicores"
    unit:
      type: "millicores"

  # Memory Utilization (%) table settings
  # Affects the table in section "4.3 Memory Utilization by Service/Host"
  memory_utilization:
    show_allocated_column: true    # Show "Allocated" column (e.g., "8.00 GB")
  
  # Memory Usage (GB/MB) table settings
  # Affects the table in section "4.3.1 Memory Usage by Service/Host"
  memory_usage:
    show_allocated_column: true    # Show "Allocated (GB)" column
    # Unit configuration for comparison report tables
    # Options: "gb" (default) or "mb"
    unit:
      type: "mb"

# Future configuration options (planned)
# ======================================
# The following options are planned for future releases:
#
# display_options:
#   decimal_precision: 2           # Number of decimal places for numeric values
#   empty_value_placeholder: "N/A" # Text to display for missing values
#   date_format: "YYYY-MM-DD"      # Date format for report headers
#   time_format: "HH:mm:ss"        # Time format for timestamps
#
# chart_options:
#   default_width: 1280            # Default chart width in pixels
#   default_height: 720            # Default chart height in pixels
#   show_grid: true                # Show grid lines on charts
#   include_legend: true           # Include legend on multi-series charts
