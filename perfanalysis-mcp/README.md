# Performance Analysis MCP Server

Welcome to the Performance Analysis MCP Server! üéâ This Python-based MCP server is built with **FastMCP** to provide comprehensive analysis of BlazeMeter load testing results correlated with Datadog infrastructure metrics for performance bottleneck identification and optimization insights.

***

## ‚ú® Features

- **BlazeMeter Results Analysis**: Process JMeter JTL files for response time aggregates, error rates, throughput, and SLA compliance validation
- **Datadog Infrastructure Analysis**: Analyze CPU and memory metrics from both traditional hosts and Kubernetes services during test execution
- **Cross-Correlation Analysis**: Identify relationships between performance degradation and infrastructure resource constraints
- **Statistical Anomaly Detection**: Detect outliers and unusual patterns in both performance and infrastructure metrics using configurable sensitivity thresholds
- **Bottleneck Identification**: Pinpoint specific performance limiting factors and resource saturation points with prioritized recommendations
- **Multi-Run Trend Analysis**: Compare up to 5 test runs to track performance improvements or regressions over time
- **AI-Powered Executive Summaries**: Generate actionable insights and optimization recommendations using OpenAI GPT models
- **Multiple Output Formats**: Export results in JSON, CSV, and Markdown formats for downstream reporting and analysis
- **Consistent Architecture**: Built using the same modular patterns as BlazeMeter and Datadog MCP Servers for seamless integration

***

## üèÅ Prerequisites

- Python 3.12.4 or higher installed
- Access to BlazeMeter and Datadog artifact folders containing test results and metrics
- OpenAI API key for AI-powered summary generation (set in `.env`)
- Completed BlazeMeter and Datadog data collection from previous test runs

***

## üöÄ Getting Started

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd perfanalysis-mcp
```


### 2. Create \& Activate a Python Virtual Environment

This ensures the MCP server dependencies do not affect your global Python environment.

#### On macOS / Linux

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```


#### On Windows (PowerShell)

```powershell
python -m venv venv
.\venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
pip install -r requirements.txt
```


### 3. Configure Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the project root with your OpenAI API credentials:

```env
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
```

Ensure your `config.yaml` is configured with the correct artifacts path pointing to your BlazeMeter and Datadog data.

***

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Running the MCP Server

### Option 1: Run Directly with Python

```bash
python perfanalysis.py
```

This runs the MCP server with the default `stdio` transport ‚Äî ideal for running locally or integrating with Cursor AI.

### Option 2: Run Using `uv` (Recommended) ‚ö°Ô∏è

You can use **uv** to simplify setup and execution. It manages dependencies and environments automatically.

#### Install `uv` (macOS, Linux, Windows PowerShell)

```bash
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
```


#### Run the MCP Server with `uv`

```bash
uv run perfanalysis.py
```


***

## ‚öôÔ∏è MCP Server Configuration (`mcp.json`)

You can configure how Cursor or other MCP hosts start the server by adding to your `mcp.json` file:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "perfanalysis": {
      "command": "uv",
      "args": [
        "--directory",
        "/path/to/your/perfanalysis-mcp",
        "run",
        "perfanalysis.py"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

Replace `/path/to/your/perfanalysis-mcp` with your local path.

3. **Cross-Correlate Data**
    - `correlate_test_results`: Identify relationships between performance degradation and infrastructure constraints
4. **Detect Anomalies**
    - `detect_anomalies`: Find statistical outliers and unusual patterns in both performance and infrastructure data
5. **Identify Bottlenecks**
    - `identify_bottlenecks`: Pinpoint specific performance limiting factors and optimization opportunities
6. **Generate Executive Summary**
    - `summary_analysis`: Create AI-powered comprehensive summary with actionable recommendations
