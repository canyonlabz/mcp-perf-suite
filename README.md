# MCP Perf Suite

> **⚠️ This project is under active development. Features, modules, and documentation may change frequently. Use at your own risk and please report any issues or suggestions!**

Welcome to the **MCP Perf Suite** — a modular collection of MCP servers designed to support and streamline performance testing workflows.

---

## 📖 Overview

This repository hosts multiple MCP servers, each designed for a specific role in the performance testing lifecycle:

### 🧪 Test Creation & Execution
- **JMeter MCP Server:**  
  Generate JMeter scripts from Playwright-captured traffic. Convert structured JSON into JMX files, execute JMeter tests, monitor them in real time, and analyze performance results.

- **BlazeMeter MCP Server:**  
  Interact with BlazeMeter’s API to manage workspaces, projects, tests, and fetch run results.

### 📊 Monitoring & Analysis
- **Datadog (Application Performance Monitoring) MCP Server:**  
  Pull and correlate monitoring and metrics data from Datadog to complement load test results.

- **Performance Test Analysis MCP Server:**  
  Perform deep analysis of BlazeMeter test results alongside Datadog system metrics (e.g., CPU, Memory). Includes log analysis of both JMeter and Datadog logs, followed by time-series correlation across datasets to detect anomalies and provide actionable insights.

### 📑 Reporting & Collaboration
- **Performance Reporting MCP Server:**  
  Generate formatted reports (e.g. PDF, Word, Markdown) from test data and analysis files for presentation and decision-making.

- **Confluence MCP Server:**  
  Publish Performance Test reports by converting Markdown files into Confluence XHTML format.

- **Microsoft Graph MCP Server:**  
  Integrate with Microsoft Graph API to streamline performance testing workflows. Upload artifacts to SharePoint for centralized storage, and use Teams integration to coordinate test execution and share results across the team.

## 🔄 Pipeline & Workflow

The MCP servers in this repository (and external integrations like Playwright MCP) form a complete performance testing pipeline. This workflow illustrates how scripts are created, validated, executed, monitored, analyzed, and finally reported and shared across teams.

## 🛣️ Future Roadmap 

### Upcoming: Schema-Driven Architecture

The MCP Perf Suite is evolving toward a **schema-driven architecture** that enables true modularity and extensibility. The core principle: **standardized data contracts between MCPs ensure that adding new data sources doesn't require changes to downstream consumers.**

#### Key Benefits

| Benefit | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Extensibility** | Add new APM tools or load test platforms by implementing an adapter that outputs the standard schema |
| **Loose Coupling** | PerfAnalysis and PerfReport MCPs remain unchanged when new data sources are added |
| **Community Contributions** | Clear schema contracts make it easy for contributors to add support for their preferred tools |
| **Maintainability** | Changes to source APIs (e.g., Datadog v3) only affect their respective adapter, not the entire pipeline |

#### Planned Milestones

- [ ] **APM MCP Server**: Unified entry point supporting multiple APM tools via adapter modules
  - Datadog (current implementation migrated as adapter)
  - New Relic adapter
  - Dynatrace adapter  
  - AppDynamics adapter
  - Splunk APM adapter

- [ ] **Load Test MCP Server**: Unified entry point supporting multiple load testing tools
  - BlazeMeter (current implementation migrated as adapter)
  - LoadRunner adapter
  - Gatling adapter
  - k6 adapter
  - Locust adapter

- [ ] **Schema Documentation**: Formal JSON/CSV schema specifications for data interchange

### Other Planned Enhancements

- Enhance the **Test Analysis MCP Server** utilizing OpenAI GPT or other LLMs for enhanced test result analysis
- Add test results log analysis to identify potential issues or bottlenecks
- Continue refinement of the **Reporting MCP Server** to produce executive-friendly reports and dashboards from test analysis data
- Enable seamless workflow orchestration across MCP servers for a comprehensive performance testing pipeline
