# AI-Assisted Report Revision Workflow

This workflow orchestrates the AI-assisted revision of performance test reports using a Human-In-The-Loop (HITL) approach. It enables iterative refinement of report sections through three PerfReport MCP tools that work together to discover data, generate revisions, and assemble the final report.

## Workflow Overview

The report revision workflow executes the following steps:

1. **Discovery Phase** - Gather all available data files and context
2. **AI Generation Phase** - Generate revised content for enabled sections (Cursor/AI)
3. **Save Revisions Phase** - Save each revised section with version tracking
4. **Assembly Phase** - Assemble the final revised report
5. **HITL Iteration** (Optional) - Refine revisions based on user feedback

This workflow supports both `single_run` reports and `comparison` reports.

## 0. Prerequisites Collection

**Before starting, collect ALL required information from the user:**

### Required Information

- **Test run ID** (run_id) - The test run identifier for single_run reports, or comparison_id for comparison reports
- **Report type** - "single_run" (default) or "comparison"

### Optional Information

- **Additional context** - Project name, purpose, feature/PBI details from ADO/JIRA
  - Example: "The project name is 'Micro Front-End APIs (MFE)' and the purpose is to test the migration of GUI applications moving from IIS to AKS."
- **Sections to revise** - If user has preferences on which sections to revise

### Prerequisites Checklist

**For Single-Run Reports:**
- [ ] Performance test report has been generated (`create_performance_test_report`)
- [ ] Report exists at `artifacts/{run_id}/reports/performance_report_{run_id}.md`
- [ ] Analysis data exists at `artifacts/{run_id}/analysis/` (JSON, CSV, MD files)
- [ ] Desired sections are enabled in `report_config.yaml` under `revisable_sections.single_run`

**For Comparison Reports:**
- [ ] Comparison report has been generated (`create_comparison_report`)
- [ ] Report exists at `artifacts/comparisons/{comparison_id}/comparison_report_*.md`
- [ ] Comparison metadata exists at `artifacts/comparisons/{comparison_id}/comparison_metadata_*.json`
- [ ] Individual run reports exist for each run in `run_id_list`
- [ ] Desired sections are enabled in `report_config.yaml` under `revisable_sections.comparison`

**Do not proceed until the original report has been generated.**

## Comparison Report Revision (Specific Guidance)

When `report_type="comparison"`, the revision workflow has key differences from single-run reports:

### Comparison-Specific Sections

| Section ID | Placeholder | Description |
|------------|-------------|-------------|
| `executive_summary` | `{{EXECUTIVE_SUMMARY}}` | Overall comparison findings |
| `key_findings` | `{{KEY_FINDINGS_BULLETS}}` | Trends and insights across runs |
| `issues_summary` | `{{ISSUES_SUMMARY}}` | Aggregated issues from all runs |

**Note:** These are different from single-run sections:
- Single-run uses `key_observations` → Comparison uses `key_findings`
- Single-run uses `issues_table` → Comparison uses `issues_summary`

### Comparison Report Paths

```
artifacts/comparisons/{comparison_id}/
├── comparison_report_*.md              # Original report
├── comparison_report_*_original.md     # Backup (after revision)
├── comparison_report_*_revised.md      # AI-revised report
├── comparison_metadata_*.json          # Metadata
├── comparison_metadata_*_original.json # Backup metadata
├── charts/                             # Comparison charts
└── revisions/                          # AI revision files
    ├── AI_EXECUTIVE_SUMMARY_v1.md
    ├── AI_KEY_FINDINGS_BULLETS_v1.md
    └── AI_ISSUES_SUMMARY_v1.md
```

### AI Content Guidelines for Comparison Reports

When generating AI content for comparison reports, consider:

1. **Trends Analysis:**
   - How performance changed across runs
   - Whether improvements or degradations occurred
   - Pattern identification (stable, improving, degrading)

2. **Multi-Run Context:**
   - User load scaling (e.g., 25 → 100 → 250 → 500 VUs)
   - Throughput changes across runs
   - Success rate consistency

3. **Infrastructure Insights:**
   - CPU/Memory scaling behavior as load increases
   - Resource utilization patterns
   - Correlation between load and resource usage

4. **Aggregated Issues:**
   - Recurring issues vs one-time issues
   - Issues resolved between runs
   - Critical patterns requiring attention

**Example Executive Summary for Comparison:**
> "Analysis of 5 test runs (25-750 VUs) shows stable system performance under increasing load. Throughput scaled linearly from 1.76 to 161.54 req/sec while maintaining 99.98%+ success rate. CPU utilization increased proportionally (220 → 1040 mCPU) indicating healthy resource scaling. Minor latency increase at P90 for authorization endpoints suggests potential optimization opportunity."

## 1. Initialize Task Tracking

Create task items to monitor progress through the revision workflow:

- [ ] Discovery: Run discover_revision_data
- [ ] AI Generation: Read data files and generate content
- [ ] Save Revisions: Run prepare_revision_context (per section)
- [ ] Assembly: Run revise_performance_test_report
- [ ] Review: User reviews revised report
- [ ] HITL Iteration (if needed)

---

## 2. Discovery Phase

### 2.1 Run discover_revision_data

Use the `discover_revision_data` tool to gather all available data:

```
Tool: discover_revision_data
Parameters:
  - run_id: The test run ID (required)
  - report_type: "single_run" or "comparison" (default: "single_run")
  - additional_context: User-provided context string (optional)
```

**The tool returns:**
- `data_sources`: Organized file paths by MCP source (blazemeter, datadog, analysis, reports)
- `revisable_sections`: All sections with enabled/disabled status
- `enabled_section_count`: Number of sections ready for revision
- `revision_output_path`: Where revision files will be saved
- `existing_revisions`: Any previous revision versions per section
- `revision_guidelines`: Instructions for generating content

### 2.2 Validate Discovery Results

Before proceeding, verify:
- At least one section is enabled (`enabled_section_count > 0`)
- Required data files exist in `data_sources`
- If no sections enabled, inform user to update `report_config.yaml`

**If no sections are enabled:**
```
User action required: Enable sections in report_config.yaml

Location: perfreport-mcp/report_config.yaml
Section: revisable_sections.single_run (or .comparison)

Set enabled: true for desired sections:
- executive_summary
- key_observations  
- issues_table
```

---

## 3. AI Generation Phase

### 3.1 Read Data Files

Based on the `data_sources` from discovery, read the relevant files to build context:

**Priority files for single_run reports:**
1. `artifacts/{run_id}/analysis/performance_analysis.json` - Core metrics
2. `artifacts/{run_id}/analysis/performance_summary.md` - Human-readable summary
3. `artifacts/{run_id}/analysis/infrastructure_analysis.json` - Infrastructure metrics
4. `artifacts/{run_id}/analysis/correlation_analysis.json` - Correlations
5. `artifacts/{run_id}/blazemeter/test_config.json` - Test configuration
6. `artifacts/{run_id}/reports/performance_report_{run_id}.md` - Current report

**Priority files for comparison reports:**
1. `artifacts/comparisons/{comparison_id}/comparison_metadata_*.json` - Run IDs and config
2. `artifacts/comparisons/{comparison_id}/comparison_report_*.md` - Current comparison report
3. For each run in `run_id_list`:
   - `artifacts/{run_id}/reports/report_metadata_{run_id}.json` - Individual run metrics
   - `artifacts/{run_id}/analysis/performance_analysis.json` - Detailed metrics per run

**Read these files to understand:**
- Test results and success rates
- Response time metrics (avg, P90, P95, P99)
- Error counts and types
- Infrastructure utilization (CPU, Memory)
- Correlation insights
- **For comparison:** Trends across runs, scaling behavior, pattern identification

### 3.2 Generate Revised Content

For each enabled section, generate improved content following these guidelines:

#### Executive Summary Guidelines
- Provide a high-level overview of test results
- Include key metrics: success rate, avg response time, throughput
- Highlight any critical issues or SLA violations
- Keep to 3-5 sentences or bullet points
- Mention the test environment and date if relevant
- If `additional_context` was provided, incorporate project context

#### Key Observations Guidelines
- List 3-7 key observations from the test
- Use bullet points for clarity
- Include both positive findings and concerns
- Reference specific APIs or services when relevant
- Prioritize observations by impact

#### Issues Table Guidelines
- Create a markdown table of issues observed
- Include columns: Issue Type, Severity, Count/Impact, Affected Endpoint, Description
- Sort by severity (Critical > High > Medium > Low)
- Include error rates and specific error messages if available
- Reference the affected APIs or endpoints
- For HTTP errors, recommend reviewing JMeter logs for specific error messages

**Writing Style:**
- Professional tone suitable for leadership/stakeholders
- Concise but informative
- Include specific metrics and data points
- Use markdown formatting (headers, bullet points, tables)

**Technical Term Definitions:**

When using technical or statistical terms that non-technical stakeholders may not understand, follow these guidelines:

1. **For 1-2 technical terms:** Add a small footnote section immediately after the Key Observations section with brief definitions.

   ```markdown
   > **Terms:** *Coefficient of variation (CoV)* — A measure of response time consistency; values >1.0 indicate high variability and potentially unstable performance.
   ```

2. **For 3+ technical terms:** Add a "Glossary" section at the end of the report, just before "Report Generation Details". Use a table format with anchor links from the terms above.

   ```markdown
   ## 📚 Glossary
   
   | Term | Definition |
   |------|------------|
   | Coefficient of Variation (CoV) | A statistical measure of response time consistency. Values >1.0 indicate high variability. |
   | P90/P95/P99 | Percentile response times — 90%, 95%, or 99% of requests completed within this time. |
   | SLA | Service Level Agreement — The maximum acceptable response time for an endpoint. |
   | Throughput | Number of requests processed per second (req/sec). |
   ```

**Common Terms Requiring Definition:**
- Coefficient of Variation (CoV)
- Percentiles (P90, P95, P99)
- SLA (Service Level Agreement)
- Throughput
- Latency vs Response Time
- Error Rate
- mCPU (millicores)
- Connection Pool

## 4. Save Revisions Phase

### 4.1 Run prepare_revision_context (Per Section)

For each section with generated content, save it using the `prepare_revision_context` tool:

```
Tool: prepare_revision_context
Parameters:
  - run_id: The test run ID (required)
  - section_id: Section identifier (required)
    - Valid values: "executive_summary", "key_observations", "issues_table"
  - revised_content: The AI-generated markdown content (required)
  - report_type: "single_run" or "comparison" (default: "single_run")
  - additional_context: User context that was used (optional, for traceability)
```

**The tool returns:**
- `section_full_id`: Composite ID (e.g., "single_run.executive_summary")
- `revision_number`: Version assigned (1, 2, 3...)
- `revision_path`: Full path to the saved file
- `previous_versions`: List of any existing versions

### 4.2 Repeat for Each Enabled Section

Call `prepare_revision_context` once for each enabled section:

1. If `executive_summary` is enabled → save executive summary content
2. If `key_observations` is enabled → save key observations content
3. If `issues_table` is enabled → save issues table content

**Track which sections were saved and their version numbers.**

---

## 5. Assembly Phase

### 5.1 Run revise_performance_test_report

Assemble the final revised report using the `revise_performance_test_report` tool:

```
Tool: revise_performance_test_report
Parameters:
  - run_id: The test run ID (required)
  - report_type: "single_run" or "comparison" (default: "single_run")
  - revision_version: Specific version to use (optional, defaults to latest)
```

**The tool:**
1. Backs up original report to `performance_report_{run_id}_original.md`
2. Backs up metadata to `report_metadata_{run_id}_original.json`
3. Replaces placeholders with AI-revised content
4. Saves revised report to `performance_report_{run_id}_revised.md`
5. Updates metadata with revision info

**The tool returns:**
- `revised_report_path`: Path to the new revised report
- `backup_report_path`: Path where original was backed up
- `sections_revised`: List of sections that were revised
- `revision_versions_used`: Dict mapping section_id to version used
- `warnings`: Any non-fatal warnings

### 5.2 Validate Assembly Results

After assembly, verify:
- `status` is "success"
- `sections_revised` contains all expected sections
- `revised_report_path` file exists
- Review any warnings

---

## 6. User Review

### 6.1 Present Revised Report

After assembly, present the results to the user:

1. Display the path to the revised report
2. Summarize which sections were revised
3. Show the version numbers used
4. Note any warnings from the assembly

### 6.2 Ask for Feedback

Ask the user:
- "Would you like to review the revised report?"
- "Are there any sections that need further refinement?"
- "Should I make any adjustments to the content?"

---

## 7. HITL Iteration (Optional)

If the user requests changes, repeat the workflow for specific sections:

### 7.1 Gather Feedback

Collect specific feedback from the user:
- Which section needs revision?
- What changes are needed?
- Any additional context to incorporate?

### 7.2 Re-generate Content

Generate new content incorporating the feedback.

### 7.3 Save New Version

Call `prepare_revision_context` again for the section:
- The tool will automatically increment the version number
- New file will be created (e.g., `AI_EXECUTIVE_SUMMARY_v2.md`)

### 7.4 Re-assemble Report

Call `revise_performance_test_report` with the new version:
- Optionally specify `revision_version` to use a specific version
- Or omit to use the latest version for each section

### 7.5 Repeat Until Satisfied

Continue the HITL loop until the user approves the revised report.

---

## 8. Final Output Summary

After the revision workflow completes, provide a summary:

### 8.1 File Locations

**For Single-Run Reports:**
- Original report (backed up): `artifacts/{run_id}/reports/performance_report_{run_id}_original.md`
- Revised report: `artifacts/{run_id}/reports/performance_report_{run_id}_revised.md`
- Revision files: `artifacts/{run_id}/reports/revisions/`
- Metadata: `artifacts/{run_id}/reports/report_metadata_{run_id}.json`

**For Comparison Reports:**
- Original report (backed up): `artifacts/comparisons/{comparison_id}/comparison_report_*_original.md`
- Revised report: `artifacts/comparisons/{comparison_id}/comparison_report_*_revised.md`
- Revision files: `artifacts/comparisons/{comparison_id}/revisions/`
- Metadata: `artifacts/comparisons/{comparison_id}/comparison_metadata_*.json`

### 8.2 Revision Summary Table

| Section | Versions Created | Final Version Used |
|---------|------------------|-------------------|
| executive_summary | v1, v2 | v2 |
| key_observations | v1 | v1 |
| issues_table | v1 | v1 |

### 8.3 Next Steps

Inform the user of available next steps:
- Publish revised report to Confluence using `confluence-mcp`
- Generate additional charts with `create_chart`
- Create a comparison report if multiple test runs exist

---

## Error Handling

### Discovery Errors

If `discover_revision_data` fails:
- Check if the run_id is correct
- Verify the artifacts folder exists
- Ensure the original report was generated first

### Save Errors

If `prepare_revision_context` fails:
- Check if the section_id is valid
- Verify the content is not empty
- Check the report_type matches the run_id

### Assembly Errors

If `revise_performance_test_report` fails:
- Verify revision files exist in the revisions folder
- Check that at least one section is enabled
- Review the warnings for specific issues

---

## Important Notes

1. **Prerequisites:** The original report must exist before running the revision workflow. Run `create_performance_test_report` first.

2. **Configuration:** Sections must be enabled in `report_config.yaml` before they can be revised. All sections are disabled by default.

3. **Version Management:** Each call to `prepare_revision_context` creates a new version. Previous versions are preserved for comparison.

4. **Backup Safety:** The original report and metadata are backed up before any modifications. Backups are not overwritten if they already exist.

5. **Report Types:** Use `report_type="single_run"` for individual test reports and `report_type="comparison"` for comparison reports. The paths are different:
   - single_run: `artifacts/{run_id}/reports/`
   - comparison: `artifacts/comparisons/{comparison_id}/`

6. **HITL Best Practice:** When iterating, provide specific feedback to improve subsequent versions. Include what worked well and what needs adjustment.

7. **Confluence Publishing:** After finalizing the revised report, it can be published to Confluence using the standard Confluence workflow with the revised report file.
